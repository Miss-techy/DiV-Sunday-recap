//Creating an app that allows a user to store items they want to buy at the market(add items, delete items,etc)

item = "pineapple";																//from the prompt into a variable called item.
																
																
//whenever the person reloads the page and enters  pawpaw, when they click add or submit we get the value pawpaw inside our array														
																
//The next step is to add the pawpaw to the array. To add an element into an array can be done with the push method in javascript

//The next step, if you want to display all these to the user, you now need to know what method in the javascript array can I use to display all the elements or console.																
																
//Theres a function called the forEach(). Once the element is an array when you call on the forEach function it should be able to give you every element inside the array.

itemsArray.forEach   //This is the first approach

//The second approach is to use the for loop
